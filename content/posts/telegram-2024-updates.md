Telegram is always loved by users and has a wide community. It never fails to impress its users and lovers. Even more people started using it due to its ease of use and its features. In the past, the telegram has continuously made improvements and added new features that are really appreciatable. Today we'll see some of the new telegram features introduced in 2024.

### Group Updates

On Feb 29, 2024, Telegram unveils the best updates for groups. In these updates, telegram introduces a new feature in which admins can post group stories. Admins can share replies from stories in group chat which is a better way to start a conversation on a new topic.

**Themes:** Admins can now change the appearance of the group according to the group's nature. They can change the group's background color, logo, or profile image. They can also change the theme(background of chat) that will be visible to all customers. Now emojis and styles can be added after the name of the group in the About mood.

**Premium Emojies:** All members of higher-level groups can use a custom emojis premium pack in the group even if they don't have any premium subscription. This feature isn't for all groups but for some groups. Users can only use those emojis which the admins will select.

**Voice Caption:** The voice message sent in the upper-level group can be translated. The group members can also enjoy this voice-to-text feature without any subscription. This feature is only for chosen groups.

### New Sticker Creation Feature

You can now create your own stickers from photos. You need to get an image and you can add telegram's built-in text, drawings, animated stickers, or GIFs to edit the sticker to look more lively and make it suit the impression of the time. You can remove the background with a few clicks. If the auto background remover doesn't work well you can use its manual erase or restore feature to edit the background of the sticker.

**Sets of Stickers:** Well, you created a bunch of flower stickers. But it's very frustrating to go and pick that specific sticker, you created, every time. To get rid of this headache you can create a set of flower stickers. You don't need to worry about finding the exact sticker, you can go into that sticker set and find yours.

**Share with loved ones:** Suppose you want to share the sticker with your friend, or family member. You can share the collection of stickers with one click instead of sending it one-by-one. Just select the set of stickers you want to share and send it within chat.
