A lot of companies and organizations were attacked by cyber criminals, today we'll see some common and major techniques used in cyber attacks and how to stay safe from getting an attack.

### Human Error
It's a very common mistake we often make. We click on malicious links, or we use easy-to-guess passwords. Hackers can get personal data with these little mistakes.
We should use strong passwords which contains alphabets, nubmer, and symbols that can't be accessed very easily. Always use trusted websites and links to not get aimed by any attacker. 

### Software Vulnerabilities
The software you use may contain bugs or may need improvements. This gives hackers an open way to get into your system and get all the data from it.      
Always keep checking for your software updates and keep it updated. Before installing any software read the instructions carefully and use trusted software only. Use trusted platforms to download the software. 

### Phishing
Phishing is a very common way of tricking people into giving their data such as passwords or credit card details. Hackers create trustworthy forms, emails, or websites so when a user clicks any malicious link or fills up a form he gives personal data to the attacker.  
Using email filtering tools to block suspicious email can keep you save from Phishing. Don't fill up forms on every website. 

### Weak Authentication
It means using easy passwords and not adding any additional security measures, which makes it easier for attackers to get access to personal data. 
Using a strong password and adding more security layers to it can prevent hackers from getting access to your data. You can use two-factor authentication (TFA) and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to make it a little bit more safe.

### Unsecured IoT Devices
Many Internet of Things (IoT) devices, like smart cameras, or thermostats have weak security which can be easy targets for hackers. 
These things come with default passwords we should change passwords before getting them to work. Configure these devices to minimize exposure, disable unnecessary features, and ensure they are on a separate network from more critical systems.
