### About the project:
They named this safety project **Massdrive**, this project is set to revolutionize the approval and certification process for autonomous vehicles, ensuring their safety and reliability as they hit the roads.

*Professor Saber Fallah* a key figure in the project, says they want to work together with car makers, rule setters, teachers, government people, and local communities.

Following government announcement last November they're making new rules for self-driving cars in the UK. **Massdrive** has taken on the crucial task of developing rigorous safety testing protocols for self-driving vehicles.

Mr. Fallah, highlighted the initiative's goal of fostering open dialogue and knowledge sharing among scientists, regulators, and the public to address safety concerns associated with autonomous driving.


> "Our main goal is to make sure these cars are safe," -*Professor Saber*.

> "We're going to talk a lot, have meetings, and share ideas to make sure the smart systems in the cars are trustworthy."
