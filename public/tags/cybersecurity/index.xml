      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the high pace and dynamism of the world of cybersecurity, AI proves itself very handy for the fight against evolved cyber threats. Integration of technologies AI and ML therefore makes security measures proactive, further easing threat detection and early mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;component-content pagebody component&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h3 id=&#34;ai-enabled-threat-detection-and-response&#34; class=&#34;pagebody-header&#34;&gt;&#xA;    AI-Enabled Threat Detection and Response&#xA;  &lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI and ML do make cybersecurity better, as the text is correct: they analyze vast amounts of data almost in real-time so as to be able to single out any signals concerning a security breach. This goes a long way in enabling the organization to detect threats before any harm is done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
